### Code Along Using Glitch

To complete the code examples included in these courses, we will be using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). Glitch is an online code editor that allows you to create and view websites without the need to install anything on your computer. It also allows you to create a server, all within the Glitch interface.

The Glitch code editor environment looks like this:

The red box above indicates the online editor where you will be typing HTML and CSS. The green box indicates the button that will take you to the live version of the page you are creating. The yellow box is the button that lets you create a copy of this project and edit it. The blue box indicates the files that you have available. In the assets folder, you can find your images.

Throughout these courses, you will need various images to complete the exercises. All of the images you need to complete these courses are contained within our Glitch projects. To view the images in your project, click on the assets entry in the list of files on the left-hand side of the Glitch editor. To get the link to any single image, select the image from the list of assets on the right-hand side. Click the “copy” button next to the URL in the pop-up that appears. You can then use that link anywhere an image is needed.

{{ image('/static/img/courses/beginner/image12.png', 371, 354,  align='center', caption='The details pop-up (including URL) for an image in the assets collection') }}

Open any of the projects below to begin. Click the “Remix This” button on the top right-hand side to create a new project that you can edit. You can continue to use this editor for this and future courses. You don’t have to use Glitch to complete these trainings. However, some of the code required to complete the exercises is only contained in the Glitch samples. If you’d like to use another editor, you may still need to use the Glitch samples to find this code.

### Code Samples

Code samples are split across three separate projects. Most samples are for the Chico's Cheese Bikes shop website that we'll build from scratch and continue to iterate on across all three courses. The other two projects will be used in the advanced course and involve recreating common website styles - a video site and an ecommerce site.

You can complete the courses by starting with any of the code samples below. Every one of them contains all of the:

- CSS
- Server Code
- Images
- Additional Content

That you need to complete the entire set of courses. There is no need to switch between repositories!
